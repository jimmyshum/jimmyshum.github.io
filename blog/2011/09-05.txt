Today I have attended COMPS258F and MATHS121F

During COMPS258F lesson, the lecturer has given us 2 lecture notes.I think I have to study these notes thoroughly in this week in order to catching up the course procedure for getting a high GPA in this semester. 

As for the MATHS21F lesson, the lecturer has only gone through what we have to learn in this year and taught some introductary maths.I hope I can aim a high GPA in this course. 

Good Luck to me.
